		      I'm working with <a href="mailto:jalford14@libety.edu">Kaite Edwards</a> and I help program weekend services while also doing relational ministry with the students.  I wanted to be an intern because I wanted to learn a lot and also be prepared to run my own ministry.  After I'm done I want to get a job in junior high/youth ministry.

		      I'm working with Saddleback Kids and I help the team pre produce the childrens' curriculum. I work closely with the director and gather props/locations/actors for the series. I also help in post production and rough edit the footage.  I joined the internship because I felt like God called me to work here.  A lot of what I hoped to achieve has happened.  I hope to learn the things I need to go into production and honor God in it.  After the internship, I am hoping to get a job creating films and bringing Christ into the film world. I also hope to help create stories that point others to God's love.

		      I'm working under <a href="mailto:jalford14@libety.edu">Ben Farr</a> and I've helped built this website. I joined the program mostly because I wanted some work experience and to learn about how Saddleback Church runs.  I also wanted to learn how to code a computer because that's what I plan to major in.  After the program I plan to go back to school and complete my sophmore year.
