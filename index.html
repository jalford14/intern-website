		      I'm working with Saddleback Kids and I help the team pre-produce the childrens' curriculum. I work closely with the director and gather props/locations/actors for the series. I also help in post-production and rough edit the footage. I joined the internship because I felt like God called me to work here and, a lot of what I hoped to get done during my internship has happened. I'm hoping that from this experience, I will learn all the things necessary needed to go into production and honor God in that area. After the internship, I am hoping to get a job creating films and bringing Christ into the film world. I also hope to help create stories that point others to God's love.

		      I'm working under <a href="mailto:mikeb@saddleback.com">Mike Brook</a> and <a href="mailto:leog@saddleback.com">Leo Galarza</a> and I do anything they ask me to and I also help with social media.  I joined mostly because I thought I might have a lot of free time during the summer and I wanted to be a part of this ministry. My hope in the future is to extend this internship to a full year and continue with school and work.

		      I'm working with <a href="mailto:meganb@saddleback.com">Megan Bagnall</a> and I help plan events, weekend services, and learn all components of ministry.  I became an intern because I've been a volunteer in Wildside for the past 4 years and I feel called to ministry and from this,  I hope to gain experience and learn how to do full time ministry.  After I'm done here, I plan to go back to Seattle and graduate in two years, and hopefully come back to work in a church.

I joined the internship because I wanted to see what working youth ministry was like and to see if it's what I want do as a career. As of right now, I'm not quiet sure what I want to do after my time here, but I'm going to move back home so I can stay involved in HSM.

I became an intern for the work experience, to learn as much about Saddleback as possible, and because I love it here.

		      I'm working under <a href="mailto:matth@saddleback.com">Kyle Cleaveland</a> and I have been working on projects supporting the church launch in Manila and have been working with staff on helping them to mobilize the congregation for PEACE trips.  I joined the program after being recommended to apply here by my college. I fell in love with what Saddelback does through PEACE and the model of how it's implemented. I want to learn about how PEACE actually looks as it is walked out and how you build relationships with communities.  After my internship, I'm heading back to Gordon to start my junior year.

I grew up at Saddleback and over the last year I have really been feeling called to ministry so that's why I became an intern.  Through this summer, I'm really hoping to learn the logistics of how PEACE works and what areas I am really passionate about.  After I'm done working here, I want to study abroad in Brazil for 4 months.

		      I'm working under <a href="mailto:jasonl@saddleback.com">Jason Letih</a> and I help with social media management, website upkeep, budget track, studio maintenance, promotional campaigns, gallery hangs, and art installations.  I became an intern because the ministry offers the unique, yet obvious, combination of art and Jesus.  I wanted to get involved in an art community and work on administrative/marketing skills, but more importantly, I wanted a stronger relationship with Jesus and Ex Creatis offers all three.  I'm not sure what I want to do when I'm done but, I know that I will return to Washington DC for school. As far as work plans, I really don't know what path I will take.

After my time here, I want to finish school and then come right back for round two here at Saddleback.

I became an intern because I was very interested in being able to apply what I have been learning in school, and other areas of ministry, in a new setting.  I hope to take advantage of the wide span of knowlege available through the awesome staff at Saddleback and gain practical experience in church planting.  Once I'm done being an intern, I will be spending a semester in Yosemite studying philosophy and humanities with APU, then I will continue my studies at school before graduating.
