		      I'm working with Saddleback Kids and I help the team pre produce the childrens' curriculum. I work closely with the director and gather props/locations/actors for the series. I also help in post production and rough edit the footage.  I joined the internship because I felt like God called me to work here.  A lot of what I hoped to achieve has happened.  I hope to learn the things I need to go into production and honor God in it.  After the internship, I am hoping to get a job creating films and bringing Christ into the film world. I also hope to help create stories that point others to God's love.

		    <p>
		      I'm working with <a href="mailto:jalford14@libety.edu">Megan Bagnall</a> and I help plan events, weekend services, and learn all components of ministry.  I became an intern because I've been a volunteer in Wildside for the past 4 years and I feel called to ministry.  I hope to gain experience and learn how to do full time ministry.  After I'm done here, I plan to go back to seattle and graduate in two years, and hopefully come back to work in a church.

		      I'm working under <a href="mailto:jalford14@libety.edu">Alaina Hart</a> and I help with all things summer camp related.  I joined the internship because I wanted to see what working youth ministry was like and to see if it's what I want do for as a career. As of right now, I'm not quiet sure what I want to do after my time here, but I'm going to move back home so I can stay involved in HSM.

		      I'm working with <a href="mailto:jalford14@libety.edu">Katie Edwards</a> and I plan the weekend services and the summer events. I became an intern for the work experience, to learn as much about Saddleback as possible, and because I love it here.  This fall, I plan on starting school as a Christian Ministries major at Azusa Pacific University.

		    <p>
		      I'm working under <a href="mailto:jalford14@libety.edu">Kyle Cleaveland</a> and I have been working on projects supporting the church launch in Manila, and have been working with staff on helping to mobilize the congregation for PEACE trips.  I joined the program after being reccomended to apply here by my college. I fell in love with what Saddelback does through PEACE and the model of how it's implemented. I want to learn about how this acually looks as it is walked out and how you build relationships with communities.  Heading back to Gordon to start my junior year.

		      I'm working under <a href="mailto:jalford14@libety.edu">Kyle Cleveland</a> and Mike Constantz and I do some suport for the global campuses, global nights, skills training, and getting materials ready.  I grew up at Saddleback and over the last year I have really been feeling called to ministry so that's why I became an intern.  Through this summer, I'm really hoping to learn the logistics of how PEACE works and what areas I am really passionate about.  After I'm done working here, I want to study abroad in Brazil for 4 months.

		      I'm working under <a href="mailto:jalford14@libety.edu">Jason Letih</a> and I help with social media management, website upkeep, budget track, studio maintenance, promotional campaigns, gallery hangs, and art installations.  I became an intern because the ministry offers the unique, yet obvious, combination of art and Jesus.  I wanted to get involved in an art community and work on administrative/marketing skills, but more importantly, I wanted a stronger relationship with Jesus and Ex Creatis offer all three.  I'm not sure what I want to do when I'm done but I know that I will return to Washington DC, but as far as work plans, I really don't know.

Most of my work revolves around individual and group growth.  I became an intern because I wanted to know the ins and outs of ministry and I hope to gather enough skills in my time here to start my own ministry at CBU.  After my time here, I want to finish school and then come right back for round two.

		    <p>
		      I'm working under <a href="mailto:jalford14@libety.edu">Kyle Cleveland</a> and Katherine Strauss and I assist in putting together guides for global campuses, I help in brainstorming new outreach events, and I learn from the PEACE staff about various projects and global issues.  I became an intern because I was very interest in being able to apply what I have been learning in school, and other areas of ministry, in a new setting.  I hope to take advantage of the wide span of knowlege available through the awesome staff and gain practical experience in church planting etc.  Once I'm done being an intern, I will be spending a semester in Yosemite studying philosiphy and humanities with APU, then I will continue my studies at school before graduating.
